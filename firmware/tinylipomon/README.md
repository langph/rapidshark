Tiny Lipo Battery Monitor
=====================

Small ATTiny84 board for monitoring high power lithium polymer batteries
connected in series. Due to differences in manufacturing, the cells in them
will often vary in voltage and capacity, so a close eye must be kept to make
sure none are close to over-charge (>4.2V/cell) or near drained (<3.2V/cell).

This is the firmware for the project, which you should be able to load on an
ATTiny84 of your own using the Ardunio IDE (1.6+) and the attiny board add-on
(available in the board manager).

Probably deserves it's own project, but for now getting stashed here.
